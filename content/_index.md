## Hello there! :wave:

I'm a Senior Engineering Manager with [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) where I'm focused on helping our core platform team deliver amazing outcomes for our Octopus Deploy customers.

I love technology and I love learning - I'm always on the lookout for new languages, ideas, processes and practices to explore and add to my toolbox, to then help the the teams and amazing developers I work with everyday :heart:

Over many years (I've stopped counting :smile:) I've worked on a wide variety of applications and on an even wider variety of operating systems, cloud providers and programming languages.
