## Background {{< icon "backward-solid" >}}

I have over 20 years experience as a Senior Developer, a Product Lead, Principal Consultant and now a Senior Engineering Manager at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/). I have successfully delivered unique software solutions over a wide variety of domains, from medical device manufacturing and medical imaging, to mining, finance, IoT, and autonomous vehicle control.

I have worked with most major platforms and a large array of technologies, from simple websites, to enterprise scale mobile applications and advanced desktop visualization software.

### Professional Life

In my current role as a Senior Engineering Manager, I am focused on uplifting our internal teams and creating an environment within which our people and teams thrive. 

I'm passionate about bringing your whole self to work and as a manager and leader, I am always looking for opportunities to positively challenge and grow the amazing people that I get to work with.

I firmly believe that in order to build complex software solutions that delight users, teams must be highly collaborative, product led and cross-functional. This is the best way to unearth innovative, but inherently valuable and human-centred software.

Below are some of the various skills I've accumulated over the years, including languages, platforms, paradigms and tooling, in no particular order. Everything listed here I have used to varying degrees, although the majority in a commercial capacity at one time or another (ie, relating to code deployed into a production environment), with a few exceptions, like [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), where I've only explored it for professional development or personal hobby projects.
